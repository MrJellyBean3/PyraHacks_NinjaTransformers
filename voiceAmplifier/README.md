# Voice Amplifier

This program amplifies voices and allows pitch to be lowered in real-time.

The user is able to set the volume of incoming audio and the degree to which pitch is lowered. It is most effective when used with earphones.

This is very useful as it allows real-time audio processing that adjusts incoming audio to meet the users needs. It is mainly designed for elderly individuals who are experiencing hearing loss. The pitch lowering function is essential as age-related hearing loss tends to affect an individual's ability to hear higher pitched sounds more severely. Therefore, lowering pitch can significantly aid elderly individual's ability to hear the noises around them.

This project incorporates concepts in bilogy as it is designed according to biological functions. It also incorporates physics by altering the amplitude and frequency of sound.
