This program uses a yolov8 AI model to do inferencing on images of different sizes to determine your cpu's or gpu's AI image processing speed at different image resolutions with a easy to use tkinter UI. This is helpful for understanding how quickly your computer can do AI inferencing and for learning about how resolution affects speed. For example I did not know that the performance would stay consistent until after 720p with 144p being the same as 720p.
