# Facial Redness Detector
This app allows the user to access their camera to detect any redness on the face.

This is mainly designed for individuals who want to purposefully apply makeup with the aim to decrease the appearance of redness on their face that may be caused by sunburn, acne, allergies or rashes. The camera will display 2 frames, one with the original colours displayed and the other where any redness is detected and highlighted. The user can keep the camera open while applying makeup and focus certain products or a greater amount of products towards the redder areas highlighted.

This incorporates concepts of biology as it aims to help conceal redness caused by underlying biological processes or conditions such as rosacea, psoriasis etc.
